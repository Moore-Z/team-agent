# SMART Goals

SMART is a mnemonic acronym, giving criteria to guide in the setting of objectives. The SMART criteria are commonly attributed to Peter Drucker's management by objectives concept.

## What does SMART stand for?

-   **S - Specific**: The goal should be clear and specific, otherwise you can't focus your efforts or feel truly motivated to achieve it. It answers the "What," "Why," and "Who."

-   **M - Measurable**: A goal needs to have criteria for measuring progress. If there are no criteria, you will not be able to determine your progress and if you are on track to reach your goal.

-   **A - Achievable**: Your goal also needs to be realistic and attainable to be successful. It should stretch your abilities but still remain possible.

-   **R - Relevant**: This step is about ensuring that your goal matters to you, and that it also aligns with other relevant goals.

-   **T - Time-bound**: Every goal needs a target date, so that you have a deadline to focus on and something to work toward. It helps prevent everyday tasks from taking priority over your longer-term goals.
