# The Eisenhower Matrix

The Eisenhower Matrix, also known as the Urgent-Important Matrix, is a simple tool for prioritizing tasks. It helps you decide on and prioritize tasks by urgency and importance, sorting out less urgent and important tasks which you should either delegate or not do at all.

## The Four Quadrants

Tasks are sorted into one of four quadrants:

1.  **Quadrant 1: Urgent and Important (Do First)**
    - These are tasks with deadlines or crises. They should be handled immediately.
    - Example: A project deadline tomorrow, a critical client issue.

2.  **Quadrant 2: Not Urgent but Important (Schedule)**
    - These are long-term goals and strategic planning tasks. You should schedule time for these.
    - Example: Exercise, long-term planning, relationship building.

3.  **Quadrant 3: Urgent but Not Important (Delegate)**
    - These tasks often interrupt you but don't help you achieve your goals. Delegate them if possible.
    - Example: Some meetings, responding to certain emails, interruptions.

4.  **Quadrant 4: Not Urgent and Not Important (Eliminate)**
    - These are distractions and should be eliminated.
    - Example: Mindless web browsing, time-wasting activities.
