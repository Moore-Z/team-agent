# The Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

## Core Steps

1.  **Choose a task**: Decide on the task to be done.
2.  **Set the timer**: Set the Pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes).
3.  **Work on the task**: Work on the task until the timer rings.
4.  **End work when the timer rings**: Put a checkmark on a piece of paper.
5.  **Take a short break**: Take a short break (3-5 minutes).
6.  **Repeat**: After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15-30 minutes).

## Benefits

- Improves focus by creating a sense of urgency.
- Reduces burnout by scheduling regular breaks.
- Helps in tracking time and improving estimation for future tasks.
